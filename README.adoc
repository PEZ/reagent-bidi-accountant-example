= Example project: Reagent client side routing with Bidi and Accountant

A simple example trying to demonstrate a way to do client side routing with
Bidi and Accountant in Reagent projects.

## Setup

I have also tried to configure the project to support an  interactive development
workflow. To start the example run:

    lein repl

Wait for the `routing-example.user` prompt and then issue:

    (start)

Open your browser at http://localhost:3449/[localhost:3449]. You will
have Figwheel's magic enabled.

If you are using Emacs you can start the repl using CIDER jack-in (issuing
that same `(start)` command at the `routing-example.user` prompt) and enjoy
the magic of a CIDER enabled development workflow. (This is extra handy for
when you are learning how to set up Bidi routing tables.)
